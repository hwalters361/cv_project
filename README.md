# OpenCV Object Detection Tutorial in Python

In this tutorial, we will introduce you to OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library. You will use it with Python and NumPy in Google Colab to isolate out specific RGB colors with an accompanying threshold in a video. To do so, you will learn how to process video input, create a bitmask, and use edge detection and contouring. We will also teach you how to integrate a color selecting widget using Matplotlib and IPyWidgets.
